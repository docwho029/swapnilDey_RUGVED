# hi, to whoever's checking my code - i thought i was being super clever by using compact one-line syntax, 
# this very evidently backfired, because this is not readable in the slightest. 
#however, it works. i've basically taken multiple nested if-else loops for each letter. 
# if letter ascii value > z, then subtract by 26. else add by 26.
# this is pretty much my logic. more than willing to explain in person if required. cheers.

'''

shift = 1
123 > 122
123 - 26
